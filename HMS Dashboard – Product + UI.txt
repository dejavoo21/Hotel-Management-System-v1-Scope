## 1. HMS Dashboard – Product + UI Spec

### Overall style

* Clean, light theme similar to the Lodgify shots:

  * Background: `#F5F7FA` or very light grey.
  * Card background: white with soft shadow and 12–16px border radius.
  * Primary accent: soft lime/green (e.g. `#C8F36A` or `#A7E163`).
  * Secondary accent: teal or mint (e.g. `#37B9A6`).
  * Text: dark slate (`#111827` / `#4B5563`).
* Use plenty of **white space**, rounded corners, subtle drop shadows.
* All cards should be **clickable** with hover elevation.

**Filter row (under top bar)**

* Time period dropdown: `Today | Last 7 Days | Last 30 Days | Custom`.

### Behaviour & UX

* Cards and charts should:

  * Show **tooltips** on hover.

* All sections must be **responsive**:

  * On tablet: 2-column layout.
  * On mobile: stacked cards, charts simplified.

## 2. Prompt to Give Your Coding Agent / Tool

You can literally copy-paste and adapt this:

> You are building a **Hotel Management System dashboard** in React + TypeScript with a Node/Express backend.
> Style and layout should closely follow modern examples like Lodgify and the screenshots I provided: light pastel UI, rounded cards, lots of white space, subtle shadows and green/mint accent colors.
>
> ### Tech requirements
>
> * Frontend: React + Vite, TypeScript, using TailwindCSS for styling.
> * Component structure: Dashboard page composed of reusable `Card` components, `KpiCard`, `ChartCard`, `TableCard`.
> * Charts: Use Recharts.
> * Layout: fixed left sidebar navigation, main content scrolls, max-width 1400px and centered.
>
> ### Dashboard layout
>
> 1. **Top bar** with:
>
>    * App logo + “Dashboard” title
>    * Global search input (“Search room, guest, booking, etc.”)
>    * Right side: notification bell, user avatar, dropdown.
> 2. **Filter row** below top bar:
>
>    * Time period dropdown (`Today | Last 7 Days | Last 30 Days | Custom`)
>    * Property selector and channel selector.
> 3. **KPI cards row**:
>
>    * New Bookings, Check-ins Today, Check-outs Today, Total Revenue.
>    * Each card shows current value, % change vs last period, and a small icon.
> 4. **Room & occupancy section**:
>
>    * Left: Room Availability card with stacked bar showing Occupied, Reserved, Available, Out of Service.
>    * Center: Occupancy line/area chart (last 7/30 days) with toggle and summary text.
>    * Right: Guest Rating card with overall rating and category bars (Cleanliness, Service, Comfort, Location, Food, Wi-Fi).
> 5. **Reservations & booking mix section**:
>
>    * Bar chart “Reservations – Last 7 days” by status (Booked, Cancelled, No-show).
>    * Donut chart “Booking by Platform” (Direct, OTAs, Corporate, Other).
> 6. **Operations section**:
>
>    * Today’s Tasks list with type, due time, and status pills plus “Add task” button.
>    * Housekeeping status donut (Clean, Cleaning, Dirty, Out of Service) with click-to-filter.
>    * Compact Booking List table with ID, guest name, room, stay dates, status, total and action buttons.
> 7. **Revenue section**:
>
>    * Revenue bar chart with tabs for `Revenue | ADR | RevPAR`.
>    * Finance KPI cards for “This month revenue”, “This month expenses”, “Gross profit”, “RevPAR”.
>
> ### Data
>
> * For now, use **mock data** in the frontend (JSON arrays) but keep functions easily switchable to API calls.
> * Each card and chart must have **typed props** and be reusable.
>
> ### UX details
>
> * Cards are clickable and raise on hover.
> * Charts show tooltips on hover.
> * Clicking a KPI or chart segment should call a placeholder `onDrillDown` handler that we can later wire to routing.
> * Implement responsive behaviour: 3-column layout on desktops, 2 columns on tablets, stacked on mobile.
>
> Please generate:
>
> * `DashboardPage.tsx` containing the full layout.
> * Reusable components under `components/dashboard/` (e.g. `KpiCard.tsx`, `RoomAvailabilityCard.tsx`, `OccupancyChart.tsx`, `TasksList.tsx`, `BookingsTable.tsx`, `RevenueChart.tsx`).
> * Tailwind utility classes directly in JSX instead of separate CSS.
> * Mock data in `dashboardMockData.ts` file.
