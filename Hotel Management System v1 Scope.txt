============================================================
1. Product vision (for us + future marketing)

HotelOS – Modern Hotel Front-Office in your browser
For boutique & mid-sized hotels who want:

Fast check-in / check-out

Clear room & housekeeping status

Simple billing & reports

A UI that staff can learn in 1 day

We optimise for:

Speed at the front desk (fewest clicks, keyboard-friendly)

Clarity (at-a-glance status, strong use of colour and icons)

Low training (labels in plain language, tooltips, no jargon)

2. Core user roles (v1)

We design screens specifically for these:

Receptionist

Create bookings, check in/out, take payments

Front Office Manager

See occupancy, rates, adjust bookings, see daily reports

Housekeeping lead

See clean/dirty/out-of-service, mark rooms, see priorities

Hotel Owner / Admin

View revenue, occupancy, configure rooms & users

3. V1 feature set (competitive but realistic)

We’ll build a clean, core HMS, not everything big players do:

3.1 Dashboard (Home)

Purpose: When someone logs in, they should understand the day in 5 seconds.

Cards across the top:

Today’s arrivals (e.g. 12) – “View arrivals list”

Today’s departures – “View departures list”

Current occupancy – % and colour (green/amber/red)

Rooms out of service – quick link

Balance in-house (optional later)

Plus:

Mini “Today’s timeline”: Now → night, showing arrival/departure spikes

Alerts strip (e.g. “3 overbookings”, “2 rooms not yet cleaned”)

UX: Use colour & icons, but very minimal text. Everything clickable for drill-down.

3.2 Room & Availability View (competitive piece)

This is usually where products stand out.

We’ll have two views:

Grid View (Rooms status today)

List of rooms vertically

Status pill: Available / Occupied / Dirty / Out of service

Small icon if maintenance, VIP guest, late checkout etc.

“Check in” / “Check out” button on each row where appropriate.

Timeline View (Simplified Gantt / Tape chart)

Horizontal days for next 14–30 days

Bars representing bookings per room

Colour by status: Confirmed, In-house, Checked-out, Tentative

Click a bar → open booking side panel

Design: Think “Notion + calendar”, soft card UI, lots of white space.
Functionally competitive with many budget PMS systems.

3.3 Bookings

New booking form:

Guest name, email, phone

Check-in / check-out dates

Room type (Standard / Deluxe / Suite)

Number of guests

Source (Direct / Booking.com / Walk-in)

Special requests textarea

Booking list & search:

Search by name, date, booking reference

Filters by status (Confirmed / Cancelled / No-show / In-house / Checked-out)

Booking details drawer (slide-in from right):

Guest info

Stay dates, room/room type

Charges summary

Notes & activity log (who changed what)

3.4 Check-in / Check-out flow (must be super smooth)

Check-in flow (from dashboard or booking):

Click Check in on booking

Modal shows:

Confirm dates, assigned room (auto-suggest next available, but editable)

Number of guests

Option: “Print registration card” (future)

Click Confirm → booking becomes In-house, room status becomes Occupied

Check-out flow:

Click Check out

Show bill preview:

Room charges (rate × nights)

Taxes

Extras

Any previous payments

Balance due

Choose payment method (Cash, Card, Bank / POS ref)

Confirm → generate invoice number + mark stay Checked-out, room status Dirty

Everything should fit in one modal with clear steps – no jumping between pages.

3.5 Housekeeping Board

Separate view optimised for housekeeping:

Group rooms by floor or building

Each room card:

Room number

Status: Clean / Dirty / Inspection / Out of service

Expected: Arrival today? Stayover? Departure just done?

Filters:

“Show only Dirty / Inspection”

“Show only my assigned rooms”

Quick actions:

Click card → small menu: Mark as Clean, Mark as Out of service, Report maintenance issue

This can be used on tablet or mobile later – so keep simple, big buttons.

3.6 Guest & Billing (simple but professional)

We won’t do full accounting, but we’ll look professional:

Guests list

Show name, contact info, last stay, total nights

Invoices

Each check-out generates an invoice record:

Invoice number, date, guest, amount, status (Paid / Partially paid / Unpaid)

Ability to re-open invoice for view / print / PDF (later)

UX tip: Put a small “Print / Download” icon on invoice pages. Branding with hotel logo for a premium feel.

4. Visual style & UX guidelines

To make it attractive & modern, let’s define some design rules you can follow in React:

Palette (example)

Primary: #2563EB (blue-600) – buttons, highlights

Accent: #F97316 (orange-500) – warnings / special statuses

Success: #16A34A (green-600)

Error: #DC2626 (red-600)

Background: #F9FAFB (very light gray)

Cards: white with subtle shadow

Components style

Card-based layout, rounded corners, soft shadow (box-shadow: 0 10px 25px rgba(15,23,42,0.06)).

Use icons for room status, arrivals/departures, housekeeping (Heroicons or Lucide).

Top navigation bar with:

Logo / app name

Main sections: Dashboard · Rooms · Bookings · Housekeeping · Reports · Settings

User avatar / role at right

Use right-side drawers for details instead of full page reloads.

Keep forms two-column for wider screens, stacking on mobile.

5. Technical structure (React + Node)
API (Node + Express, v1)

Main endpoints:

POST /auth/login

GET /dashboard/summary

GET /rooms / PATCH /rooms/:id (status updates)

GET /availability (for timeline)

GET /bookings, POST /bookings, PATCH /bookings/:id

POST /bookings/:id/checkin

POST /bookings/:id/checkout

GET /housekeeping/rooms

GET /guests, GET /invoices

Database: Postgres or SQLite to start; tables:

users, roles

rooms, room_types

bookings

guests

stays (optional – split from booking)

charges, payments

housekeeping_status_history (later, for audit trails)

Frontend structure

/src/pages

DashboardPage.tsx

RoomsPage.tsx (status & timeline tabs)

BookingsPage.tsx

HousekeepingPage.tsx

GuestsPage.tsx

SettingsPage.tsx

/src/components

DashboardCards/…

RoomStatusGrid.tsx

AvailabilityTimeline.tsx

BookingForm.tsx

BookingDrawer.tsx

HousekeepingBoard.tsx

InvoiceView.tsx

This keeps things modular and ready for future growth.

6. What we should do next

To keep moving and stay practical, I suggest:

Lock the v1 screen list and navigation.

Design one key screen in detail first – either:

Dashboard, or

Rooms & Availability (big differentiator)

Then I can:

Sketch the exact layout + components for that screen

Give you a React component skeleton with modern styling using Tailwind (or plain CSS, your choice).
=========================================================================================================

1. Dashboard layout (what users see)
Top bar

App / hotel name on the left.

On the right:

Date range filter (Today / Next 7 days / This month)

Property selector (if multi-hotel later)

User avatar / role.

Section A – Today’s priorities (alert strip)

Horizontal row of 2–3 “priority cards”:

High-risk rooms (overbooked / VIP arrivals not assigned)

Rooms not yet cleaned but needed for today’s arrivals

Late check-out requests

Each card is clickable and coloured (red/amber/green) so staff see what to act on right now.

Section B – KPI cards

A row of 5 cards:

Today’s Arrivals

Today’s Departures

Current Occupancy

Rooms Out of Service

In-house Guests

Each card:

Big number

Small label (e.g. “+3 vs yesterday”)

Icon

Entire card clickable → drill-down page.

Section C – Occupancy & revenue snapshot

Two cards side-by-side:

Today’s Occupancy Trend

Simple horizontal bar with occupancy percentage and colour.

Booking mix

Tiny donut-style legend listing sources:

Direct, OTA (Booking.com, etc), Corporate

(For now, we’ll fake these with simple bars/legends – no chart library needed yet.)

Section D – Tables (action lists)

Two columns:

Left: “Arrivals & Departures today”

Tabs: Arrivals | Departures

Small table:

Time, Guest name, Room/Type, Status (Confirmed, Checked in, No-show)

Action button: Check in / Check out / View

Right: “Housekeeping snapshot”

List:

Clean rooms

Dirty rooms

In inspection

Out of service

Plus a mini list: “Next rooms to clean” with room + reason.

2. Basic data shapes (for now, dummy data)

We’ll use simple arrays:

type PriorityItem = {
  id: string;
  level: "high" | "medium" | "low";
  title: string;
  description: string;
  actionLabel: string;
};

type KpiCard = {
  id: string;
  label: string;
  value: string;
  delta?: string; // e.g. "+3 vs yesterday"
};

type ArrivalDeparture = {
  id: string;
  time: string;
  guestName: string;
  roomType: string;
  roomNumber?: string;
  status: string;
};

type HousekeepingSummary = {
  clean: number;
  dirty: number;
  inspection: number;
  outOfService: number;
};

3. React dashboard component (with Tailwind)

✅ This assumes you already have Tailwind wired into your Vite/React project.
If you don’t, keep this file; we can set up Tailwind next, or I can convert this to plain CSS later.

Create src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx:

import React, { useState } from "react";

type PriorityItem = {
  id: string;
  level: "high" | "medium" | "low";
  title: string;
  description: string;
  actionLabel: string;
};

type KpiCard = {
  id: string;
  label: string;
  value: string;
  delta?: string;
};

type ArrivalDeparture = {
  id: string;
  time: string;
  guestName: string;
  roomType: string;
  roomNumber?: string;
  status: string;
};

type HousekeepingSummary = {
  clean: number;
  dirty: number;
  inspection: number;
  outOfService: number;
};

const priorities: PriorityItem[] = [
  {
    id: "p1",
    level: "high",
    title: "3 rooms needed for arrivals are still dirty",
    description: "Housekeeping needs to clean before 2pm check-in.",
    actionLabel: "View rooms",
  },
  {
    id: "p2",
    level: "medium",
    title: "2 VIP arrivals today",
    description: "No welcome notes added yet.",
    actionLabel: "Prepare welcome",
  },
  {
    id: "p3",
    level: "low",
    title: "1 room out of service",
    description: "Leaking tap – maintenance scheduled.",
    actionLabel: "View maintenance",
  },
];

const kpiCards: KpiCard[] = [
  { id: "arrivals", label: "Today’s arrivals", value: "18", delta: "+3 vs yesterday" },
  { id: "departures", label: "Today’s departures", value: "12", delta: "-1 vs yesterday" },
  { id: "occupancy", label: "Current occupancy", value: "76%", delta: "Target 80%" },
  { id: "oos", label: "Rooms out of service", value: "2", delta: "1 due today" },
  { id: "inhouse", label: "In-house guests", value: "43", delta: "Avg stay 2.4 nights" },
];

const arrivals: ArrivalDeparture[] = [
  { id: "a1", time: "11:00", guestName: "Anna Roberts", roomType: "Deluxe King", status: "Confirmed" },
  { id: "a2", time: "13:30", guestName: "James & Laura", roomType: "Family Suite", status: "Checked-in" },
  { id: "a3", time: "16:00", guestName: "Corporate – ACME Ltd", roomType: "3x Standard", status: "Confirmed" },
];

const departures: ArrivalDeparture[] = [
  { id: "d1", time: "10:00", guestName: "Michael Smith", roomType: "Standard", roomNumber: "204", status: "Checked-out" },
  { id: "d2", time: "11:00", guestName: "Sara Khan", roomType: "Deluxe Twin", roomNumber: "311", status: "Bill pending" },
  { id: "d3", time: "12:00", guestName: "Group – Green Corp", roomType: "5x Standard", status: "In-house" },
];

const housekeeping: HousekeepingSummary = {
  clean: 28,
  dirty: 7,
  inspection: 3,
  outOfService: 2,
};

const DashboardPage: React.FC = () => {
  const [adTab, setAdTab] = useState<"arrivals" | "departures">("arrivals");

  const occupancyValue = 76; // percent for bar
  const coverageScore = 85;
  const evidenceScore = 78;
  const riskScore = 83;

  const bookingMix = [
    { label: "Direct", value: 42 },
    { label: "OTAs", value: 38 },
    { label: "Corporate", value: 20 },
  ];

export default DashboardPage;


To show this in your app, you can use it in App.tsx:

import DashboardPage from "./pages/DashboardPage";

function App() {
  return <DashboardPage />;
}

export default App;


If you don’t have Tailwind yet, you’ll see unstyled HTML. In that case, next step can be:

I walk you through adding Tailwind to your existing Vite + React project, or

I convert this layout to plain CSS modules.

For the HMS project, I’d strongly recommend Tailwind because it lets us iterate on UI much faster and keep everything consistent.

If you’re happy with this layout, the next step after this dashboard is usually the Rooms & Availability view, since that’s the heart of daily operations.

========================================================================================
Nice, then let’s keep going and add the **Rooms & Availability** screen – this is the “heart” of the HMS.

I’ll:

1. Explain the layout (so you know what you’re getting)
2. Give you a **full React component** (`RoomsPage.tsx`) using Tailwind, like the dashboard

You can then switch between `DashboardPage` and `RoomsPage` later with simple routing.

---

## 1. Rooms & Availability – layout

We’ll do **two tabs** inside one page:

### A. “Status Today” tab

* **Filters bar** at top:

  * Floor (All / 1 / 2 / 3…)
  * Status (All / Available / Occupied / Dirty / Out of service)
  * Room type (All / Standard / Deluxe / Suite)

* **Room grid**

  * Card per room:

    * Room number + type
    * Status pill (color-coded)
    * Guest name if occupied
    * Badge for: VIP, Late checkout, Maintenance
    * Small actions: “Check in” / “Check out” / “Mark clean”

This is what front desk and housekeeping will use most.

### B. “Timeline” tab (next 14 days)

* **Mini legend**: colors for Confirmed / In-house / Checked-out / OOS, etc.
* **Simple timeline**:

  * Rooms listed vertically
  * For each room, a row with **blocks representing bookings** across the next 14 days
  * Blocks are just coloured `<div>` elements sized with `width: X%` (no chart library needed)

---

## 2. React component: `RoomsPage.tsx`

Create `src/pages/RoomsPage.tsx`:

```tsx
import React, { useMemo, useState } from "react";

type RoomStatus = "available" | "occupied" | "dirty" | "oos";

type Room = {
  id: string;
  number: string;
  floor: number;
  type: "Standard" | "Deluxe" | "Suite";
  status: RoomStatus;
  currentGuest?: string;
  notes?: string;
  flags?: ("vip" | "late_checkout" | "maintenance")[];
};

type BookingBlock = {
  id: string;
  roomNumber: string;
  guestName: string;
  startOffset: number; // days from today (0 = today)
  length: number; // number of days
  status: "confirmed" | "inhouse" | "checkedout";
};

const ALL_ROOMS: Room[] = [

    number: "102",
    floor: 1,
    type: "Standard",
    status: "dirty",
    notes: "Departure just completed",
  },
  {
    id: "r103",
    number: "103",
    floor: 1,
    type: "Deluxe",
    status: "available",

  },
  {
    id: "r202",
    number: "202",
    floor: 2,
    type: "Deluxe",
    status: "available",
  },
  {
    id: "r301",
    number: "301",
    floor: 3,
    type: "Suite",
    status: "occupied",
    currentGuest: "Green Corp – meeting",
  },
];

const BOOKING_BLOCKS: BookingBlock[] = [
  {
    id: "b1",

  },
  {
    id: "b2",
    roomNumber: "103",
    guestName: "James & Laura",
    startOffset: 2,
    length: 4,
    status: "confirmed",
  },
  {
    id: "b3",
    roomNumber: "202",
    guestName: "Walk-in guest",
    startOffset: 1,
    length: 2,
    status: "confirmed",
  },
  {
    id: "b4",
    roomNumber: "301",
    guestName: "Green Corp",
    startOffset: -1,
    length: 5,
    status: "inhouse",
  },
];

## 3. How to use this with your existing dashboard

In `App.tsx`, you could temporarily swap pages:

```tsx
import DashboardPage from "./pages/DashboardPage";
import RoomsPage from "./pages/RoomsPage";

function App() {
  // for now just switch manually:
  return <RoomsPage />;
}

export default App;
```

Later we can:

* Add a **top navigation** and simple routing (e.g. React Router)
* Hook the rooms & bookings to a **real API** instead of dummy arrays.

---

If you like this, the next steps could be:

* Wire a **minimal Node backend** for `/api/rooms` and `/api/bookings`
* Or design the **Bookings page** UI so the flows tie together.

Tell me which you’d like to do next: **backend endpoints for rooms**, or **Bookings page UI**.
